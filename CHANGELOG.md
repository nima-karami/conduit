# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Conduit. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Internal run artifacts
(build reports, audits, retrospectives) live in `docs/runs/`, not here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Documentation layout and lifecycle convention (`docs/specs` + `archive/`, dated
  names, `INDEX.md`, per-run `docs/runs/`, this changelog). See ADR 0003.

## 2026-06-11 — Round 3 ("mastermind" run, in progress)

### Fixed
- Sidebar-collapse flash and other optimistic-toggle reverts (settings echo no
  longer clobbers pending local changes).
- Unreliable save: global Ctrl/Cmd+S routed to the active document; visible save
  affordance; failures now surface as toasts; files served via go-to-def/recents
  are writable.
- Markdown rendered view now reflects saved content after a source edit; re-opening
  a file re-reads from disk.
- Diff side-by-side/inline toggle is honoured at narrow widths (no silent override).
- Three-dot menu triggers close on second click instead of reopening.
- Panel drag-dock works in both directions.
- A batch of renderer and host-side defects (palette scroll, shortcuts-while-typing,
  lost board edits, pty kill-race, settings validation, and more).

### Added
- Working Changes panel actions (stage/unstage/discard, per-file and bulk).
- Explorer create/rename/delete (path-guarded, trash delete, inline rename).
- Terminal find, clear, and right-click copy/paste menu.
- Editor depth: dirty-close confirm, Save All, Revert File.
- Markdown: clickable links (relative files open in-app, external in browser,
  anchors scroll), copy-code buttons, heading anchors.
- VS Code-style tab overflow: wheel scroll, open-editors dropdown, close left/right.
- Bulk git actions folded into a compact kebab menu (agent-first direction).
- App icon/logo wired as the window icon and into empty states.

## 2026-06-11 — Rounds 1 & 2
