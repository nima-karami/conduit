# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to Conduit. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Internal run artifacts
(build reports, audits, retrospectives) live in `docs/runs/`, not here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Custom session icons:** right-click a session → "Set icon…" to choose from the full
  Lucide icon set in a searchable, categorized, virtualized picker (synonym search — e.g.
  "delete" finds the trash icon). Reset to the auto-derived icon any time.
- **Session status now shows on the icon** instead of a separate dot: a not-running session
  is dimmed, an actively-working one pulses, and one needing attention is accented.
- **OS notifications when a backgrounded session finishes:** taskbar flash + a system
  notification (clicking it focuses Conduit and the session). On by default; toggle in
  Settings.
- **Relaunch stale sessions after a restart:** a "Relaunch all stale sessions" command, an
  opt-in "relaunch on startup" setting, and a "— session relaunched —" marker.
- **Drag-and-drop in the Files tree:** drag a file/folder onto a folder to move it; hold
  Ctrl to copy. Path-guarded so operations can't escape the project root.
- The Changes tab now shows a count badge (accented when another tab is active) when a
  session has uncommitted changes.
- Searched files now open in (and switch to) the session they belong to, and the recent-files
  list is per-session.
- Find-in-files now matches file and folder **names**, not just contents: a name hit
  surfaces the file (even binary/oversize ones), highlights the matched name, and
  shows a "name" badge.
- Documentation layout and lifecycle convention (`docs/specs` + `archive/`, dated
  names, `INDEX.md`, per-run `docs/runs/`, this changelog). See ADR 0003.

### Fixed
- The Files view now has a single "Collapse all folders" action (the old expand toggle only
  expanded already-loaded folders).
- "Reveal in Explorer" on a session now opens the folder itself, not its parent.
- A long project path no longer overflows the session card.
- The close "✕" is hidden while renaming a session, so it can't be mistaken for cancel.
- Clicking a search hit in a Markdown file now scrolls to and highlights the match in the
  **rendered** view, not only in the editor.
- A session no longer gets renamed to a running command (e.g. "npm run security")
  when a tool sets the terminal title; genuine app titles and `/rename` still win.
- Editor tabs are scoped to their session — you no longer see another session's open
  editors, and switching sessions restores that session's own view.
- The terminal view stays pinned to the bottom on a large write (e.g. a big Claude
  Code edit) instead of stranding you mid-scroll, while leaving a scrolled-up user
  alone.

## 2026-06-11 — Round 3 ("mastermind" run, in progress)

### Fixed
- Sidebar-collapse flash and other optimistic-toggle reverts (settings echo no
  longer clobbers pending local changes).
- Unreliable save: global Ctrl/Cmd+S routed to the active document; visible save
  affordance; failures now surface as toasts; files served via go-to-def/recents
  are writable.
- Markdown rendered view now reflects saved content after a source edit; re-opening
  a file re-reads from disk.
- Diff side-by-side/inline toggle is honoured at narrow widths (no silent override).
- Three-dot menu triggers close on second click instead of reopening.
- Panel drag-dock works in both directions.
- A batch of renderer and host-side defects (palette scroll, shortcuts-while-typing,
  lost board edits, pty kill-race, settings validation, and more).

### Added
- Working Changes panel actions (stage/unstage/discard, per-file and bulk).
- Explorer create/rename/delete (path-guarded, trash delete, inline rename).
- Terminal find, clear, and right-click copy/paste menu.
- Editor depth: dirty-close confirm, Save All, Revert File.
- Markdown: clickable links (relative files open in-app, external in browser,
  anchors scroll), copy-code buttons, heading anchors.
- VS Code-style tab overflow: wheel scroll, open-editors dropdown, close left/right.
- Bulk git actions folded into a compact kebab menu (agent-first direction).
- App icon/logo wired as the window icon and into empty states.
